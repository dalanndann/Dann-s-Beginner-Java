Semicolon - separator

- often used to terminate a statement
- indicates the end of one logical entity

Block - set of logically connected statements that are surrounded by opening and closing braces

- not terminated with a semicolon (end of a block is indicated by the closing brace)

End of the line is not recognized as a terminator.

x = y;
y = y + 1;
System.out.println(x + " " + y);

is same as:

x = y; y = y + 1; System.out.println(x + " " + y);

Indentation - indent one level after each opening brace, move back out one level after each closing brace
