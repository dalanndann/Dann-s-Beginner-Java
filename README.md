# Dann-s-Beginner-Java
<p>Welcome to my first repository!</p>

<p> This is where I will upload my exercises from a Java-for-Beginners ebook.</p>
    It's not much, but I'm a beginner anyway!

<p> I put comments on my works. They reflect my insights and thoughts at the moment of writi-- err, in this case, coding. </br>
    I hope, one day, as I go along the lessons, I find the answers to my unresolved notes.
</p>

<p> Thanks to the friend who led me into coding. </br>
    I've been outside looking in for a long time, </br>
    and this would have continued being 'just an interest' for much longer without your effective 'salestalk.'
</p>

Ciao, </br>
