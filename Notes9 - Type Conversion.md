It is most common to assign one type of variable to another. </br>
For example, you might want to assign an int value to a load variable: </br></br>

int i; </br>
float f; </br>
</br>
i = 10; </br>
f = 1; </br>
assign an int to a float </br>

</br>

When one type of data is assigned to another type of variable, an <i>automatic type</i> conversion will take place if

- the two types are compatible
- the destination type is larger than the source type
  A <i>widening conversion</i> will take place when the two conditions are met.
